## Setting up

The Fantasy Futbol API grants you access to a suite of features for building and managing your very own custom fantasy futbol leagues. We provide easy to use REST APIs that get you started from 0 to 100 to build and launch your fantasy futbol game.

<p>To get started you need to create an account using our REST API. This grants you access to your very own API key.</p>
