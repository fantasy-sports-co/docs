<Note>
  You have to create a free account with us in order to gain access to an API key to get started.
</Note>

## Base URL
To gain access to the REST API, all requests need to be made to the base url `https://sandbox.api.fantasyfutbol.app/v1`

## Authenticating your Requests

Authenticate your API calls using the API key provided to you on signup. 
<Note>
  We currently do not have a developer dashboard. Our signup flow does allow for secure delivery of your API key to your email using https://privatebin.net
</Note>

To autheticate your API calls, attach the below request header in your request.<br/>
`x-api-key=<YOUR_API_KEY>`

## Response Pattern
All API endpoints return responses in JSON format. The content type for responses is set to `application/JSON`.

<Note>
  Not all endpoints return the `paging` information. Endpoints that return data in paginated format will be indicated in docs.
</Note>


```JSON
{
  "statusCode": "[number]",
  "message": "[string]",
  "data": "[object]",
  "paging": {
    "page": "[number]",
    "page_total": "[number]",
    "per_page": "[number]",
    "current": "[number]",
    "total": "[number]"
  }
}
```
