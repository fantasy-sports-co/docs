<Note>
  We currently do not have a developer dashboard. Our signup flow does allow for secure delivery of your API key to your email using https://privatebin.net
</Note>

## Signing Up
To gain access to the API, you need to create a free account with us. You can do so by sending a POST request to the signup endpoint with the bellow request payload.

```HTTP POST
https://sandbox.api.fantasyfutbol.app/v1/auth/signup
Content-Type: application/json 
```

```JSON
{
    "email": "[string]",
    "first_name": "[string]",
    "last_name": "[string]",
    "company_name": "[string]",
    "password": "[string]"
}
```

## Verifying your Email
On sign up request success, you will receive an email with a validation link (see image below). Click on the link to validate your email address.
